## CLI?

It is not a understatement when I say, that the reason I am much more comfortable with a computer, am much better at trouble shooting and in the sense, look like I know what I am doing, is because of the command line. The Command Line Interface opens up a whole new world for you to explore, it is the most pure and intuitive way to operate with your system.

The command line is powerful. It is in fact so powerful, that I am sure you have heard of the popular Linux meme
```bash
rm -rf /
``` 
to delete the whole Linux operating system. The command line is that powerful.
Almost all coding tutorials you might have seen as a beginner must have gotten you annoyed as to why people would use such weird and confusing way to interact, compile and run programs.

I mean, it seemed like that to me at least. When I first opened the command line, I was not the biggest fan.
So, let change that for you

## Why so ugly

Okay, you have to admit, the default terminal looks quite unintuitive and ugly, to say the least.
