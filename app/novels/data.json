            "First up, this is not like a super official book. It is a book I wrote in my free time or whenever I felt like not coding about stuff.\n\nThis book includes completely random and unfiltered observations that I random teenager made. These might now all be like the coolest and most awesome observations and thoughts, but I thought that it would be good if I could put these thoughts somewhere, in case I forget when I am 80 years old and eating cookies and someone is shouting at me to not eat cookies since they leave cookie crumbs.\n\nOne thing though, if you are like a serious reader and don‚Äôt appreciate a little gen-z humor, read it still and leave me an angry review on twitter so that it boasts my engagement (thank you!)\n\nWith the same note though, most of this book will have a lot of gen-z slang. So, if you don‚Äôt it, you might learn something new üôÇ.\n\nIf you get offended by my humor I‚Äôm sorry.",
            "## Relative Evil and The Devil\n\nI was once travelling in the train when we came across a group of older women completely occupying 2 of our seats and giving us one of their seats at the side.\n\nNow for the people who don't know, in India, trains are a major form of transportation and these aunties: as they are called in India were going from Bangalore to Bhopal, which is a two day journey by train.\n\nNow they were not very good with us.\n\nMe and my family were ignored and they took up all the space. They were rude.\n\nNow I am generally a decent and kind person. But seeing as to we were mistreated, I started to feel justified to do bad things.\n\nI had just lost interest to do and be good. \n\nI always use headphones when I am out: I was watching YouTube with 100% Volume\nI usually offer food while eating: Gobbling up food\n\nStuff like that.\n\nIt is very weird how other people‚Äôs actions determine how we want to feel about the world around us.\nIn an ideal world, regardless of what other people do, we should be good.\n\nAll this really makes me wonder:\n\nWhat if all the evil in the world started due to a single evil person. All the other people felt like doing evil around him to take revenge on him. This led to the domino effect which is most of the bad stuff.\n\nSo was the single bad person ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äù.\n\nI know funny idea. I am laughing too."
