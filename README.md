This is the source code for my portfolio website. It is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
I am actually quite proud of it.

## [Site](https://noobscience.rocks)

## Features

Fast, responsive, and accessible. It is also a PWA, so you can install it on your phone.
All of the styles are written in good SASS, and the code is written in JSX.

## Stuff I did

I did a lot of weird stuff for my site.
One of them being having a sort of twitter like updates board, implementing a recommendation system and even integrating an Admin page to interact with the MongoDB database.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/About_next
```

2. Run `npm install`

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run `npm run dev`

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How it works

In it's essense, noobscience.rocks is a monorepo using, as vercel terms it, the FrontEnd Cloud. However, if you break it down, it is merely MongoDB, React and Edge Functions.

## Update on the Site

I believe that building this site has honestly helped me learn Next.js alot and hey! It looks so cool. I recently went through a lot of effort to make it cost sustainable as well. Hope you enjoy my site. Wanna get in touch? Contact me on [my site](https://www.noobscience.rocks/contact).
