            It's not all about frameworks.
        </h1>
        <p>
            We, as humans sometimes need to go back to the basics.
            I mean, we are not machines, we are humans.
            It's not always about the latest and greatest framework that makes a good website.
            Sometimes, it's just about the basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a simple website, made using only HTML and CSS.
            No frameworks, no libraries, no nothing.
            Just HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, one interesting thing you might notice is that this static page is being hosted by Next.js.
            Yes, you read that right.
            This static page is being hosted by Next.js.
            This site was put in the <code>public</code> folder of the Next.js project.
            And, that's it.
            No more, no less.
            I get all the benefits of Next.js, like server-side rendering, and I get to use the latest and greatest features of HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean, I think we as users have been brainwashed into thinking that we need all the fancy stuff.
            We need all the frameworks, all the libraries, all the bells and whistles.
            But, we don't.
            I mean, come on, can't you not read this page?
            Can't you not see the content?
            Can't you not understand the content?
            I mean, come on.
            We don't need all the fancy stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now all this talk coming from a guy who uses Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS.
            I know, I know.
            I'm a hypocrite.
            But, I'm just saying that we don't need all the fancy stuff.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Is this page responsive?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Yes, it is.
            This page is responsive.
            It's not perfect, but it's responsive.
            I mean, come on, it's just HTML and CSS.
            It's not like I'm using some fancy framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just use vw and vh units for the width and height of the elements.
            I use media queries to change the layout of the page.
            I use CSS variables to change the colors of the elements and the background.
