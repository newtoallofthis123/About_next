import React from 'react'

export default function VanillaIndex() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>
                Vanilla Web Pages
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am a big fan of vanilla web pages. I like the simplicity of them
                and the fact that they are easy to understand. But, maintaining and 
                updating them can be a pain. I have been using NextJS for a while now
                and I love it. I am a big fan of React and I think it is a great tool
                for building web pages. So, I decided to build my blog using NextJS.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, sometimes, I just miss the simplicity of vanilla web pages.
                So, this is an experiment if simple HTML and NextJS can work together.
