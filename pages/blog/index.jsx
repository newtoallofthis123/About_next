                    Hi! I am Ishan! I go by <a href="https://noobscience.rocks">NoobScience</a> online.
                    I am a student and technology is my <em>JAM</em>. I do have an official
                    blog on <a href="https://blog.noobscience.rocks">Hashnode</a> but I wanted a more
                    personal space to write about my thoughts and ideas. I am a big fan of
                    the vanilla web and I wanted to build this blog from scratch. So I am using
                    a NextJS base for my site. All blog posts are indiviual javascript files and
                    are compiled into static HTML pages. No database, no server side rendering.
                    No Complex CSS frameworks too.
                </p>

            {
                data.blogs.map((post) => {
                    count += 1
                    if(count < 8 && !post.wip)
                    return (
                        <div key={post.id} className="recommendations">
                            <div style={{ backgroundColor: ran_color(),}} onClick={() => {send(post.slug)}} className="recommend">
                                <div className="img">

                                </div>
                                <div className="content">
                                    <h3><Link href={`posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link></h3>
                                    <p>
                                        {post.description}
                                    </p>
                                    <button><Link href={`blog/posts/${post.slug}`} >Read the Article!</Link></button>
                                    <button><Link href={`/assets/blog/pdfs/${post.slug}.pdf`}>Download The PDF</Link></button>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    )
                })
                }
                <p>
                    Okay, as you can see I want to be not talking about technology, but it
                    leaks into my words. Anyways, this is a place I just randomly share my thoughts.
                    There's a plan for more improvements and features, but for now, this is it.

                <p>
                    I have been thinking about this for quite a while now and I want to try it
                    out. So this blog is a subsidiary of the main site <a href="https://noobscience.rocks">NoobScience</a> and
                    is hosted on the same server. The code is available on <i className="bi bi-github"></i>
                    <a href="https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/About">GitHub</a>.
                    So, if you want to write a article on this blog, you can just fork the repo,
                    write your article and send a pull request. I'll review it and merge it.
                    Cool Right ?! Feel free to try it out. More info and guidelines <em>coming soon</em>.
