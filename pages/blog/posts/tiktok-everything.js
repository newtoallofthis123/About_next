                    <p>Now I have no problem with TikTok like content as a concept. I actually respect the people behind the concept of it. I mean it is so genius. You get short bursts of information, that are easy to digest, easy to produce and very easy to market. I mean, YouTube surprised people when it rose up to be more than just a video hosting service. YouTube became well, YouTube, a place where people, regardless of their age, gender or nationality* were allowed to share their thoughts, build communities and ultimately, a livelihood. How YouTube became so popular? Well, they combined the power of understanding using visuals with the power of a algorithm that correctly gauges these videos and recommends it to users. Now there are down sides to this as well, but for the most part, YouTube was perfect.</p>
                    <p>I mean, I come from India, where the advent of Jio Technologies and Sim Cards have enable the most rural parts to have access to the internet. And most people use YouTube for their queries. They know about Google, trust me, the company has made sure that they do. But they prefer to use YouTube for searches. This shows the power of algorithms combined with the visual medium.</p>
                    <p>We as people correspond well to visuals and auditory sensations, compared to text. There is a reason why you’ll see the most newspapers having their own podcasts or including videos in their articles for better understanding. Visuals just work. You don’t need knowledge in the topic, you don’t even need to understand the language.</p>
                    <p>So with visuals having this much power over us, combine that with AI and some effective psychology, you got yourself quite an explosive combo haven’t you?</p>
                    <h2 className="atx" id="enter-tiktok">Enter TikTok</h2>
                    <p>TikTok was not an indigenous idea. I mean, it’s founding idea was rather murky. When TikTok was founded by the Chinese company Byte Dance and was first released to the Chinese public in September of 2016 under the name “Douyin”, the video sharing app. It was marketed as the alternative to banned social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram in China. It was a massive hit with the Chinese public. It’s rose further by acquiring <a href="http://Musical.ly">Musical.ly</a>, which was popular in the US. Ever since then, TikTok has 2billion downloads and is regarded as one the fastest growing social media networks in the world.</p>
                    <blockquote>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Remember, here that the idea of a lip syncing app was not new at this time. There were apps like Dumsmash and <a href="http://Musical.ly">Musical.ly</a> for that matter which were wildly popular in that niche. And this is where TikTok started to slowly but surely take over. It started to relax copyright laws by attribution, deals and creator support and started including more up-to-date, better quality music, introduced mesh powered filters to compete with apps like snapchat. The journey of TikTok going from a lip syncing app to a full blown social media is a whole ordeal or copying, unique brilliance and in some cases, support from the Chinese government. It is actually quite facinating and I recommend you check out some of the articles I will be linking below which I used for research.</p>
                    <p>Now TikTok had something unique. Moreover, it had also garnered a loyal fan base, with many TikTok creators, terming themselves influencers and having massive fanbases themselves, further boosting TikTok’s viewership and for a while, everything seemed “A Okay”. It is only later that it’s effects would be visible to a scale as today, where TikTok is a widely talked about subject and many good articles being written on the topic. But first, let’s discuss TikTok’s design</p>
                    <h2 className="atx" id="the-design">The Design</h2>
                    <p>I love a well designed product and I have to swallow a bitter pill and admit, TikTok is a damn well designed product. As TikTok was banned in India, I am not aware of it’s design changes since 2019 except ones big enough to reach the news, so take this part with a grain of salt.</p>
                    <p>First up, the logo. A logo says a lot about a company and TikTok’s logo is wacky, creative and futuristic. At least I interpret it that way. The logo encourages the user to be creative and finally post a video on TikTok, going from a TikTok user, to a TikTok creator and advocate. This can also be hinted by the placement of the create button being at the center of the navigation bar, the gold spot for any button to be; highlighting the significance of you making content on TikTok.</p>
                    <p>The user interface is also very user-friendly, with a bottom navigation bar that makes it easy to switch between different sections of the app. The app's algorithm is also very effective, serving up videos that are tailored to the user's interests and preferences. This keeps users engaged and coming back for more.</p>
                    <p>TikTok's community-building features are definitely one of its strongest assets. Users can easily connect with others who share similar interests through the use of hashtags and challenges. This creates a sense of camaraderie and makes the app more engaging for users.</p>
                    <p>The duet feature is another example of how TikTok is fostering community among its users. This allows users to record videos in collaboration with others, creating a sense of teamwork and fun.</p>
                    <p>One more interesting thing pointed out my many notable researchers is the fact that TikTok did something unique with the way they play videos. Normally, on the web, we are only used to being stimulated horizontally or in other words, a horizontal scroll. But TikTok not only has an addictive horizontal scroll, powered by what is believed to be the world’s most complex recommendation algorithm, it also has a vertical scroll, in the sense that the video’s we like, the video loops itself repeatedly until the person is satisfied.</p>
                    <p>So what this effectively sets up is a very effective way of keeping the person hooked and well, driving him into the most efficient addictive system in the world; the feedback loop. The more you scroll horizontally, the better chance you have of getting something you like and the more you scroll vertically, watching the video repeatedly till your dopamine receptors are completely satisfied.</p>
